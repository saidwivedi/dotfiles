# Global Preferences

## Git Workflow
- Never add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" attribution in commits
- Never add "Generated with Claude Code" messages in commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional

## Code Style
- Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident
- Avoid over-engineering - keep solutions simple and focused
- Don't add features beyond what was requested

## Communication
- Be concise and to the point
- Don't use emojis unless explicitly requested
- Focus on technical accuracy over validation

## Documentation & Token Conservation
- Never write summary documents unless specifically asked to
- Never create architecture diagrams unless asked to
- Avoid creating multiple documentation files for a single task
- Provide concise inline explanations instead of separate docs

## Token-Wasting Patterns to Avoid
- Don't repeat yourself - no recap messages after completing work
- Don't create "quick start" or "cheat sheet" files unless asked
- Don't write test files unless explicitly requested
- Don't create example usage files unprompted
- Don't paraphrase what you just did - user saw it happen
- Don't ask "would you like me to..." questions - just present options concisely
- Don't create wrapper scripts unless they add real value
- Don't write verbose comments in code explaining obvious things
- Skip pleasantries and status updates - be direct
- Don't create README files for simple implementations
- One response per action - don't split into multiple messages
- Use TodoWrite efficiently - don't update for every tiny step
